title: Trying to Deploy on EC2!
date: 2013-10-06

Getting closer... I'm trying to figure out how to deploy to a EC2. I'm starting to get it I think. Next I'd like to learn how to use a custom domain and not use the port number. I haven't figured out how to use the post-receive hook yet either. The goal is to update locally, push to GitHub and have the EC2 instance pull and display updates.
